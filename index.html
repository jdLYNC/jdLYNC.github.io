      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Initially my interest in coding stemmed from a love of gaming. Wanting to make my own games, I realised I needed to be able to code, so began to learn the basics. Over time this interest broadened to programming more generally.</p>
      <p>My previous career was as a scuba instructor. I loved this job but overtime grew to desire something that would challenge me more and provide greater intellectual and creative satisfaction. Coding offered this potential which led me to study web development at GA and make this my profession.</p>
      <p>For my first junior role I am seeking a full-stack position in a well established dev team. Somewhere I can grow my skills, tackle interesting problems and learn from more senior developers.</p>

          <p>I created Diveboard as a better alternative to the job sites the industry currently uses.  A MERN stack app, Diveboard integrates GoogleMaps, Places and Rest Countries APIs, bcrypt and JWT for user authentication, Axios and bluebird for http requests and bootstrap styling.</p>

          <p>Project 3 was a MEAN stack team project. Our team of two made a social travel app. Primarily I was responsible for integrating external APIs and organising team work ow through Trello. Features I independently contributed include a GoogleMap directive with contextual paths and markers, and geocoding services that enabled users to upload locations via GooglePlaces or a pin drop.</p>

          <p>Project two was a mini-project to build a RESTful app. Roquette was an Instagram-esque site with pictures of rockets. The build featured three models, including one to facilitate direct messaging and bcrypt for secure user authentication.</p>

          <p>The brief for project one was to create a browser game using front end technologies. I created a hole-in- the-wall style game primarily utilising jQuery for gameplay and animation, and vanilla JS for the logic. I found working on the JS game logic especially interesting.</p>
